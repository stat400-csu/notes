<div id="course-objectives" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
<p>Computationally intensive statistical methods are a key component to modern data analysis methods. After completing this course, a successful student will be able to use statistical software to implement both traditional and state-of-the-art methods in computational statistics as well as recognize situations where these methods are required.</p>
</div>
<div id="prerequisites" class="section level2">
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>CS160 or CS163 or CS164 or (MATH151 and MATH153)<br />
STAT 420 or concurrent enrollment.</p>
</div>
<div id="texts" class="section level2">
<h2>Texts</h2>
<p>Statistical Computing with R (2019), M. L. Rizzo</p>
<p>Optional reference: Computational Statistics (2013), G. Givens and J. Hoeting – Available online at CSU library</p>

<h2>Computing</h2>
<p>We will use RStudio (<a href="https://rstudio.com" class="uri">https://rstudio.com</a>), R (<a href="https://r-project.org" class="uri">https://r-project.org</a>), GitHub (<a href="https://github.com" class="uri">https://github.com</a>), and ggplot2 (<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org" class="uri">https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org</a>). All software is free and open source.</p>
<p><strong>Please install</strong> on your own computer, but you can also use the computers in Weber 205.</p>
<p>Please read the following website regarding use of the Weber lab: <a href="https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~dzubera/lab.html" class="uri">https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~dzubera/lab.html</a>.</p>

<div id="classwork-and-grading" class="section level2">
<h2>Classwork and Grading</h2>
<p><strong>Homework (40%)</strong> Homework will be assigned weekly. All homework assignments are due at the beginning of lecture on the due date. Each homework assignment will receive equal weight in the final grade and the two lowest homework assignment grades will be dropped. Late work is not accepted except in rare cases (see Documented emergencies below).</p>
<p><strong>Exam (30%)</strong> There will be one midterm exam on October 24, 2019 in class.</p>
<p><strong>Project (30%)</strong> There will be a final project that will consist of either</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>an analysis of real data using the computational tools learned in class, or</li>
<li>an implementation of a computational task beyond the scope of lecture and homework.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will write a paper and give an in class presentation. More details will be announced later.</p>
<p>Grades will be assigned according to the following intervals:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">A</td>
<td align="left">A-</td>
<td align="left">B+</td>
<td align="left">B</td>
<td align="left">B-</td>

<div id="policy-regarding-academic-honesty" class="section level2">
<h2>Policy Regarding Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>Statisticians need to have high ethical standards. Thus, I expect each of you to hold high ethical standards and to act with academic integrity in this class. If you have questions about what integrity means, please feel free to ask me. Behavior that will not be tolerated in this class includes turning in a copy of somebody else’s homework or code as your own, copying from somebody’s exam, or failure to cite sources.</p>
<p>This course adheres to the CSU Academic Integrity Policy as found on the Students’ Responsibilities pages of the CSU General Catalog in the Student Conduct Code. Violations will result in zero points for the assignment as a minimum penalty. In addition, CSU policy requires instructors to report violations to CSU’s Office of Conflict Resulution.</p>
</div>
<div id="attendance" class="section level2">
<h2>Attendance</h2>
<p>Attendance is required every class.</p>
</div>
<div id="documented-emergencies" class="section level2">
<h2>Documented Emergencies</h2>
<p>If you have a problem that will require you to miss an exam or homework due date, please discuss this with me in advance if possible. I can grant a rare exception when the reason relates to severe and unavoidable medical or personal emergency. Documentation will be required. Things that typically are not an emergency: vacation, family reunions, ordinary work commitments, job seeking, or other voluntary events. Please schedule these so that they do not conflict with your classes.</p>
