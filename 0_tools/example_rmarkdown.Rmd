# Big Section

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you *click* the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

1. This is a numbered list.
1. Here is the second item.
    a. sublist
    b. another one
    
- unordered list item
- item 2

Inline text. $\overline X_n = \sum\limits_i^n\frac{1}{n}X_i$

$$\overline X_n = \sum\limits_i^n\frac{1}{n}X_i$$



```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

There are `r nrow(cars)` rows in the `cars` dataset.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="This is a beautiful plot, but I wish it was ggplot!"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
